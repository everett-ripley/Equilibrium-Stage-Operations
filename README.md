# Equilibrium Stage Operations
 A collection of tools I made to solve equilibrium stage operations

This repository is a collection of individual scripts I made to automate some chemical engineering assignments.
The file names are a bit weird, and refer to their corresponding assignments, rather than functionality (it made sense at the time).
This could be expanded on, if the assignments are reduced to their pure functionality and an input/main script is created, then this could become a decent
calculator for general equilibrium stage operations problems.
